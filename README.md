## Conway's Game of Life on the SEGA Genesis

Conway's Game of Life is a celluar automation created by John Horton Conway. The basic rules of it is that any live cell and has 2 or 3 neighbors continues to survive into the next generation
and any dead cell that has 3 neighbors turns into a live cell. Every other cell dies because of under/overpopulation. This repeats infinitely. [Read more about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

This is my implementation of it from 2018. The source is here for archival purposes and is currently unmaintained.
